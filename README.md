# FizzBuzz

## Introduction

The FizzBuzz test is a (relatively) well known problem, that can be used to evaluate the problem solving capacities of an IT job candidate.

Although there have been, and are, hot debates on how to solve the problem and how to establish the quality of a candidate, those discussions are mostly besides the point. FizzBuzz is just a nice way to discuss IT and work with a candidate, using a small and isolated IT problem. No less, no more.

## Requirements

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.  
For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.  
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.  
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
